# ðŸ“ƒ Description
There is a prototype of a 2D game that I made with Unity, inspired of Flappy Bird. To do this, I used a tutorial from Game Maker's Toolkit (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM)

# ðŸ“• Resources
The assets of the bird, the pipes and the clouds were made by Game Maker's Toolkit.

# ðŸ“† Roadmap
- ~~Game over when getting out of the screen~~
- ~~Add clouds in the background~~
- Add a starting menu
- Add a wings animation
- Add sound effects
- Add my own sprites
