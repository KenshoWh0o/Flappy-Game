# ðŸ“ƒ Description
There is a prototype of a 2D game that I made with Unity, inspired of Flappy Bird. To do this, I used a tutorial from Game Maker's Toolkit (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM)

# ðŸ“• Resources
The assets of the bird, the pipes and the clouds were made by Game Maker's Toolkit.
